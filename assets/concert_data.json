This is Einaudi's first solo project in 20 years, gradually emerging during the 2020 lockdown.\n\nLudovico sat in front of the piano every day, and ideas came out of nowhere. During all the months of improvisation, he observed that every five days he would compose a melody or motif - a sketch would emerge that would later take its final form. During this period, Einaudi thought of isolated life as a parallel dimension. The new material seemed to write itself. He felt freedom, put an end to rules. There was no filter between him and the piano sounds. The name \"Underwater\" is a metaphor, a liquid dimension unaffected by the outside world.\n\n \"Underwater\" is a musical sound from another world, mainly due to the sound of silence. The composer achieved this by covering each hammer of the Steinway piano in a piece of felt.\nFascinating music performed by the Mystery Ensemble and the camera atmosphere of the hall will make the night unforgettable.
